# Problem Statement(SIH)
Application of Image Analytics for Tree enumeration for diversion of Forest Land

# Description
When forest land needs to be diverted for developmental projects, it is crucial to have an accurate understanding of the tree population within the affected area. Traditional methods of tree enumeration, such as manual surveys or ground-based assessments, can be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors.
To address these challenges, the challenge is to develop an image analytics solution that automates the tree enumeration process using satellite imagery or aerial photographs, or any other means (using section view). The proposed solution should address the following key aspects: 

•	Image Data Analysis: 
Develop a computer vision algorithm that can analyze satellite imagery or aerial photographs to detect and identify trees within the designated forest areas accurately. The algorithm should account for variations in tree species, sizes, and environmental conditions to ensure reliable results. 

•	Tree Counting and Categorization:
Design a system that can count the number of trees in the specified area and categorize them based on their species or other relevant parameters like diameter(girth). The solution should provide accurate and detailed information about the tree population to facilitate decision-making during the land diversion process. 

•	Accuracy and Validation: 
Create mechanisms to validate the accuracy of the image analytics solution by comparing the results with ground-truth data obtained through manual surveys or other reliable methods. The solution should aim to achieve a high level of accuracy and minimize false positives or false negatives in tree identification and counting. 

•	Scalability and Efficiency: 
Develop an efficient and scalable solution capable of processing large volumes of image data within a reasonable timeframe. Consider optimization techniques and parallel processing approaches to ensure timely results, especially for large forest areas or time-sensitive projects.

•	Integration and Visualization: 
Enable seamless integration of the image analytics solution with existing forest management systems or tools. Provide visualizations or interactive interfaces that allow users to explore and interpret the results easily. This could include the generation of maps, reports, or other visual representations of the tree enumeration data. 

•	Ethical and Environmental Considerations:
Ensure the solution adheres to ethical practices, respects privacy concerns, and minimizes potential environmental impact. Consider the privacy of sensitive data, secure storage of images, and compliance with environmental regulations throughout the development and deployment of the solution. By addressing these aspects, the proposed image analytics solution will facilitate efficient and accurate tree enumeration for the diversion of forest land. It will provide stakeholders with vital information to make informed decisions regarding land usage, environmental impact assessment, and conservation efforts, ensuring responsible and sustainable development.
